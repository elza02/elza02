## 🌟 Featured Projects

Here are a few projects I’m proud of:

- **[Loan Risk Analysis & Prediction](https://github.com/yourusername/market-risk-analysis)**  
  📈 *Description*:
    - Data Analysis & Feature Engineering: Cleaned and analyzed a loan dataset with 20 features, uncovering key trends
 in borrower behavior, which boosted model accuracy from 60% to 74%.
    - Risk Prediction Model: Prepared data for an XGBoost model to predict loan risk (good/bad) with a focus on
 effective feature engineering.
- **[FaceTrack - Real-Time Facial Recognition](https://github.com/elza02/FaceTrack---Real-Time-Surveillance-Data-Processing-System..git)**  
  🚀 *Description*:
  - Developed a real-time surveillance data processing system based on facial recognition using Apache Spark and the
 Kafka framework. The primary objective is to collect traffic data from a real-time facial recognition API,
 continuously analyze it, and provide real-time information on identified individuals.
- **[CGAN for MNIST Generation](https://github.com/yourusername/CGAN-MNIST)**  
  📝 *Description*:
  - Developed a Conditional GAN (cGAN) to generate MNIST digits conditioned on class labels (0-9).
  -  Designed and implemented the generator and discriminator architectures for conditional image generation.
  - Trained the cGAN using labeled MNIST dataset, achieving high-quality, controlled digit generation.
